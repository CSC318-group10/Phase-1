Problem space we chose: Diabetes monitoring system.
Target user audience: People with health issues (or more specifically diabetes) / Seniors (?)

User research plan: Email / Online survey / Face-to-face interview

My personal thoughts: The handout says we are going to explore the problem space instead of assuming having known what
exact problem is. So I think it's probably better to use the "Health monitoring system" as problem sapce and change
it to diabetes after the user research. What do you guys think?
