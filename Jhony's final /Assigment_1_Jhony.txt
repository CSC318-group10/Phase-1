Assignment 1 - CSC318
Jhony Miller Campanha

My name is Jhony Miller Campanha, and I am a computer science exchange student at University of Toronto. I started my studies at Federal University of Sao Carlos in Brazil, and now I am studying here in Toronto supported by a Brazilian’s government program called Science Without Borders. Over the past 3 years, I have been studying classification methods in machine learning applied to text automatic filtering, specifically in spam filtering in social networks. 

In Brazil, I had some group work experience in some courses, and I enjoyed very much. There are some issues about group members, but we always could solve the problems and receive good feedback from professors. 

My experience involves dividing the work and having daily or weekly meetings to discuss and help each other. Since each group member has a different schedule, it is hard to work together all the time, and that’s why I like to divide the work.


[BAD] iPhone Calendar Design

At a first sigh, iPhone’s calendar looks organized, but it has some usability issues which bother a big amount of users. We can see some difficulties in understand what is clickable and what is not and the meaning of the colors.
Using the calendar for the first time can be hard for most users. At a first sigh, you can see that almost everything in red in clickable, except for the current month name. Why are they using the same color if it is not a clickable option? Another issue is the meaning of having the weekends in grey, just like they are disable, which is not true.

In order to fix those issues, apple should work harder in usability issues instead of just a good design. Maybe creating a really good color pattern, and make clear what is supposed to be clickable and what is not.
