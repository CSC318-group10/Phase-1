	Problem space: We are interested in the management of health conditions, in how digital devices and/or apps can help people manage their health conditions.
	
	User Group: the user group that we are interested in is people who are suffering from diabetes (both types 1 and 2). For many people, this disease requires constant monitoring of health factors such as blood glucose levels.
	Monitoring is required to keep symptoms under control and reduce the risk of progression and complications. Many sufferers report ‘burn-out’ and stress from managing their condition.
	Seniors in particular are least likely to embrace technology to facilitate their management of the condition.
	
	
	We intend to seek out participants from local (Toronto) support groups and online support groups.
